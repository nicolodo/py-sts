In order to make a version of slay the spire for the gameboy
I should first figure out how to make a slay a spire at all
which is what this is.

currently figuring how you can setup cards add them to the deck
and afterwards next is to move them from deck to draw, hand and discard
all will be command line until the thing actually works

next is figuring how cards can affect other cards which will need to keep track of
what has been discarded
how many times i've been attacked, health lost, damage done, <-- this is all complicated
  bc ^ looks a lot it should be split up into smaller tasks

instancing a battle.
put on enemies
req 
  have an enemy setup
    each enemy has
    max health
    attack pattern

setup turn based battles.
